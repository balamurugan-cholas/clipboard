# 🧠 NeuroDesk v1.1.2

### *An Intelligent Desktop Assistant for Streamlined Productivity*


## 📌 Overview

NeuroDesk v1.1.2 is an Electron-based Windows application that functions as a smart clipboard manager with built-in history tracking. It continuously monitors the system clipboard, saves copied text into an SQLite3 database, and displays it through a clean user interface. By storing and organizing copied content, NeuroDesk is especially valuable for developers, professionals, and anyone who frequently works with repetitive copy-paste tasks, making workflows faster and more efficient.


## ✨ Features

* 📋 **Clipboard History** – Automatically saves all copied text into a searchable history for quick access.
* 🔎 **Real-Time Search** – Instantly find past text with live search and highlighted keywords as you type.
* 📌 **Pin & Favourites** – Keep important snippets at the top or mark them as favourites for easy reuse.
* ⏯️ **Pause/Resume Listener** – Control clipboard monitoring directly from the UI with one click.
* 📤 **Export History** – Save your clipboard data into a `.txt` file for backup or sharing.
* ⚙️ **Customizable Settings** – Enable/disable *Launch on Startup* and *Always on Top* for a personalized workflow.
* ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** – Quickly minimize (`Ctrl + M`) or reopen (`Ctrl + N`) the app without leaving your work.
* ⚡ **Enhanced Clipboard Power** – Unlike the default system clipboard (which only stores the last item), NeuroDesk offers persistent history, advanced search, and better organization.
